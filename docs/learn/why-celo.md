## Celo's Mission

The companyâ€™s mission is to build a financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for everyone. Celo enables native and non-native digital assetsâ€“both cryptographic and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)â€“to circulate freely across devices, carriers, and countries. This makes money mobile, global and accessible like never before. Celo is supported by a community of organizations and individuals, including Jack Dorsey, a16z, and Deutsche Telekom.

Since the launch of Mainnet in 2020, Celoâ€™s network now supports 1000+ projects from builders, developers, and artists, who everyday create new applications and issue digital currencies from over 100 countries around the world.
