Hitchhiker's Guide to Fundraising in the Celo Ecosystem.

---

## Overview

The process of raising capital for your company is often opaque and intimidating especially for first time founders. It’s a skill that is acquired through practice and repetition. If you’re new to fundraising, you’ll find that you’re crafting a product to sell. You’re the seller. The product is your narrative around yourself, your team, company vision and upside potential. The investors are the buyer.

We created this guide to provide Celo Ecosystem builders an end-to-end resource on fundraising best practices as well as a map of Celo’s Investor Ecosystem. While our goal isn’t to reinvent the wheel and rather it’s to distill a few key takeaways from industry experts, we hope you can leverage this guide and included links to get you a better overview of how to navigate your fundraising process.

## Raising Capital

### When should I start thinking about raising capital?

This is a tricky question that has no single right answer. We know - not the most helpful advice. However, the fact that different people will give you different answers is a major contributor to the opaqueness of fundraising. In general keep these factors in mind when considering the optimal time to start fundraising:

**Warm Relationships**

In some cases, founders may have no trouble raising capital with just an idea. Perhaps they may have warm relationships with the investors who can quantify the entrepreneurs’ track record. Frankly speaking, entrepreneurs in this category have more flexibility on when they can raise capital given the established relationships.

**No Warm Relationships**

In most situations where you’re a first time founder and may not have pre-existing relationships with investors, they’ll generally prefer that you have a vision, some form of a tangible product, attractive market size and early signs of product demand before engaging. Once you’ve achieved most of the latter, it may be a good time to start thinking about raising capital to accelerate your growth and capture more of your target market.

**Market Timing **

It’s also important to zoom out and consider the macroeconomic cycle and market timing of your potential fundraise. VC fundraising, ([https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/2021-us-vc-fundraising-exits-deal-flow-charts](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/2021-us-vc-fundraising-exits-deal-flow-charts)) and more specifically, Web3 fundraising ([https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/crypto-start-ups-raised-huge-venture-funding-rounds-in-january.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/crypto-start-ups-raised-huge-venture-funding-rounds-in-january.html)) continues to hit all time highs and at certain times it will be easier to raise capital than other cycles given investors’ need to deploy the large funds they’ve raised from their limited partners. Surfing the rising tide in these markets can potentially give you more options of capital especially if you’re building a product that is in demand.

**Seasonality**

Ensure to time your fundraising process that aligns well when investors are actively investing and have the capacity to run full due diligence processes. As a rule of thumb, try your best not to start a fundraising process around major holiday seasons to reduce the risk of extending your timeline longer than you had originally planned.

### What do I need to research before starting my fundraise?

While fundraising can take an unexpected amount of time, it’s important to optimize for efficiency to the best of your ability. The last thing you want to do is spend hours with potential investors who aren’t investing in your stage/sector of business. We’re aware of new models of fundraising emerging in Web3 (i.e. DAO-based), however our aim is to keep this guide confined to more traditional methods for simplicity.

1. Find investors who fit your target investor profile! Using the following databases/resources listed below, you can identify the investors who are actively investing in your stage/sector/geography. A good rule of thumb to use is to find investors who have made 1-2 relevant investments within the last 2-4 months.

- **Web3 Focused**

  - Celo’s Ecosystem Investors Map
  - Dove Metrics ([https://www.dovemetrics.com/](https://www.dovemetrics.com/) is an excellent resource for Web3 market fundraising data)

- **Investor Databases**

  - AngelList
  - Crunchbase
  - First Round Capital’s Angel Directory
  - NFX Signal ([https://angels.firstround.com/directory](https://angels.firstround.com/directory))

2. Once you’ve identified a subset of investors who may be a fit for your sector/geography/stage, aggregate a list in your personal database to stay organized. Some popular tools include pre-built templates on [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/templates/entrepreneurship/expQrNqXl4bUBrb8B/fundraising-crm) or even creating your own tracker on Google Sheets. As your number of conversations grows, it’s important to keep track of the status of each conversation and to understand where you should be doubling efforts to increase your chances of success.

3. If one of your target investors is a venture capital fund, take some time to look through their website as well to look for a few things

- If they show their portfolio companies, take some time to review and see if they’ve invested in any competitors. There may be a conflict of interest even if they are a sector/stage/geographical fit for you and you want to cross out these investors quickly.
- Research the team and see who may be the right person to reach. Venture capital funds often have a broad team and there may be certain individuals who are focused on your sector vs. others at the firm. You want to be sure that you’re reaching out to the right person.

4. Frankly speaking and similar to sales, cold emails to investors have a low chance of success statistically speaking. For any investors who you identify to be a prospective fit, search through your social networks and see if you may have any mutual connections. People tend to trust others who they have some history with. If you find any mutual connections, try kindly reaching out to the individual and see if they’d be willing to forward along your company’s teaser materials to the prospective investor.

5. If you’ve found a great venture capital firm and/or angel investor but have no mutual connections to the team or individual, you can attempt a cold outreach. Remember, fundraising at the earliest stages will be a numbers game. However, you also want to be as thorough and thoughtful as possible when reaching out to the investors. In sales, unique approaches can attract a few eyeballs even if they hit the inbox cold. A few things to keep in mind

- Keep the outreach email as concise as possible. Investors receive a ton of inbound in this market so you’ll only have a minute if not a few seconds of their attention. You want to get straight to the point.
- Specify why you reached out to them and why they would be a great fit for your company. (I.E. Perhaps they’ve invested in other companies that are tangential to what you’re building or have written an article with a thesis that aligns with your company vision.
- Share a few points on your company taken from your teaser materials and include your investor presentation.
  - What is the problem you’re solving for and is it a large market?
  - Why is now the best time to tackle this opportunity?
  - How are you solving this problem?
  - Traction (if applicable and **be transparent**)
  - How much are you raising?
  - What’s special about your team and why are you the ones to solve this problem?

### How much capital do I need to raise?

The rule of thumb here is to raise enough capital to give you 1 year of runway at minimum and best case 2 years of runway with the primary goal of reaching your next milestone. In other words, think through how much monthly operating capital you’ll need (across hires and other administrative budget items) and multiply that by the number of months you believe it’ll take to reach that milestone. This resulting figure can serve as a reference point but it’s often helpful to size up and down your potential round size to give yourself and investors a magnitude of what you could realistically achieve with different levels of capital. Finmark ([https://finmark.com/](https://finmark.com/)) is an example of a helpful resource that can help build out your financial plan.

### What are the different forms of capital I can raise?

While new forms of funding models emerge in Web3 and a comprehensive list will grow over time, below are a few common investment structures used by founders and investors today.

1. **Grants -** Many layer 1 protocols have recently set up ecosystem funds in order to incentivize and fund entrepreneurs who build on their technology stack. These grants generally come in the form of non-dilutive capital (meaning that the capital you take does not reduce your ownership of your company) that can help you build a minimum viable product and/or test your market hypothesis.

2. **SAFE** (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) - Ycombinator’s SAFE document has become an industry standard used for early stage fundraising and for good reasons - they provide speed and flexibility both both investors and entrepreneurs. Unlike convertible debt, SAFEs remove the need for interest payments and repayment of the debt. The capital invested on a SAFE is generally expected to convert into shares of preferred equity in a traditional priced equity round. YCombinator’s website ([https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/#about](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/#about)) provides excellent best practices on SAFEs and templates as well.

3. **SAFT** (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)** - **For a period of time during the wave of ICOs, SAFTs were frequently used by blockchain companies to raise capital. Similarly to SAFEs, they offer simplicity and efficiency however, have largely fallen out of favor due to their legal complications and precedents in the industry. Mechanically speaking, SAFTs offer investors the ability to invest capital with the opportunity to purchase the company’s tokens at a point in the future.

4. **SAFE + Token Warrants** - A combination of a SAFE and a Token Warrant has become increasingly popular for fundraising in Web3. While most investors expect financial upside on their equity in traditional companies, Web3 companies will often build and launch tokens which are available to early investors and the public at some point in the future. Ideally, these tokens will have sustainable utility and practical use cases and should therefore accrue value based on increased market adoption. As a result, companies are more commonly raising capital on SAFEs along with a token warrant that offers investors the right to tokens in the amount that is proportional to their investment in the SAFE. This gives investors exposure to both equity and potentially tokens if the companies decide to launch one in the future. The team at LiquiFi has written an excellent piece on the topic and the information provides key practical insights on methods used to allocate tokens to investors through the token warrant.

5. **Equity** - Equity rounds allow companies to set an official valuation for the company and to issue shares at a specific price. Over time, these rounds are generally reserved for Series A and later stage companies. Companies at the seed stage have raised priced rounds historically, although more of them are raising on SAFEs at the earlier stages for efficiency and speed of getting capital in the bank.

### What should I have prepared for investor conversations?

In general, you should want to prepare as much information in a digestible format ahead of time. Brieflink (​​[https://brieflink.com/](https://brieflink.com/)) is a popular resource to create a detailed company overview that you can share with investors. Having these baseline items will serve you well in requesting warm introductions to investors, cold email outreaches and investor preparation prior to an initial conversation. In general, always try to provide your prospective investors with as much information ahead of the meeting as possible to have a productive first meeting with them. You’ll show The other items on this list are useful to share with investors if they’ve shown interest after your initial meeting to pursue additional diligence and to potentially invest.

- Brieflink Page (Using [https://brieflink.com/](https://brieflink.com/))
- 1-2 Paragraph Teaser Summary
- Investor Presentation
- Product Demo
- Cap Table
- Financial Projections

### What do I need in my investor presentation?

While this guide isn’t meant to be 100% prescriptive, below are the core components of a comprehensive investor presentation. Remember, treat fundraising as if you were launching and selling a product. You want to craft a compelling enough narrative to make your company an easy choice for investors to fund.

- Company Vision (What is your company looking to become?)
- Problem (Is this a real problem and is it critical to solve?)
- Market Size (What is your Total Addressable Market? It’s okay to think big here but be realistic with data)
- Traction (Are there currently any users? TVL? Growth rates for any relevant metrics?)
- Business Model (How do you plan to monetize? What are your unit economics? In Web3, perhaps the profitability is less attributable to a dollar profit model vs. the value that you’ll accrue on a token that you’ll launch in the future)
- Solution (What is your product and how does it solve the problem? Be as clear and specific as you can here. While Web3 is nascent and can be complicated, you want to make it so that even your prospective investor can understand what it is that you’re building)
- Competitive Landscape (Competitive market map and positioning on why your product is different)
- Distribution Strategy (Are there other players in the ecosystem that you can work with to acquire other users in a low cost way?)
- Team (What is your team’s background? Are you and your team the right market & team fit?)
- Fundraising Ask & Planned Use of Capital (How much capital are you looking to raise and how are you planning to allocate that capital? What milestones are you going to achieve with this capital?)

The team at NFX has put together a [comprehensive sample pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k7Ci129LjMdrV9OPkHUpWHqn_CsVdaEkd1RhU9G_Cx4/edit#slide=id.gabb84e51a1_0_1278) with relevant examples of slides of pitch decks from other companies.

We can’t forget to mention beyond having these components to a pitch deck, it’s important to think through your presentation’s aesthetic as well. Most of you will have an investor presentation on screen while meeting investors and it’s important to remember that the engagement is both audio and visual. We’ve found that [https://www.beautiful.ai/](https://www.beautiful.ai/) is a great place to start when creating a great looking presentation.

### Post Investment Correspondence

After closing your investment round, it’s important to keep a periodic cadence with your investors for a few reasons. Firstly, it helps keep you accountable to the milestones that you’ve set for your team and mitigates the need for investors to ask you ad-hoc questions - which can generally distract you as you’re busy building your company. Secondly, it’s a great open forum to request assistance from your investors. You can also gamify your updates by shouting out investors who have been the most helpful to you so far.
